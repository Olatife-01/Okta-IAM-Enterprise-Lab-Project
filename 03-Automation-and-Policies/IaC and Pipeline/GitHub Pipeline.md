# CI-CD Pipeline Implementation

## I. Objective & Purpose

This lab details how I established a robust Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for the Enterprise IAM Lab. The goal is to automate the provisioning and management of Terraform-defined infrastructure for **Okta** and **AWS**, producing a secure, repeatable, and **idempotent** workflow. The pipeline replaces manual runs with automated format/validate/plan/apply stages, uses a remote Terraform state (**S3 + DynamoDB lock**) as the single source of truth, injects secrets securely via GitHub Actions, and gates changes by branch so AWS and Okta paths run independently but live in one repo.
By implementing this CI/CD pipeline, the project aimed to:

- **Automate Deployments**: Replace manual infrastructure provisioning with reliable, automated processes.
    
- **Ensure Idempotency**: Guarantee that applying the same configuration multiple times consistently yields the desired state without errors.
    
- **Enhance Consistency**: Standardize infrastructure deployments and reduce configuration drift.
    
- **Improve Security & Auditability**: Integrate secure credential management and provide a clear audit trail for all infrastructure changes.
    
- **Facilitate Collaboration**: Enable multiple contributors to safely manage infrastructure changes from a shared source of truth.

## II. Technical Thought Process & Evolution of Configuration

AWS and Okta are the two control planes I’m automating; both demand repeatability, least-privilege, and an audit trail strong enough for compliance. Manual CLI runs don’t scale or satisfy evidence needs, so I moved the execution to CI/CD where every plan and apply is logged, attributable, and reproducible. Terraform gives me **declarative, idempotent infrastructure**, but only if runners share a **remote state**—hence S3 for state and DynamoDB for locks to prevent concurrent corruption. I adopted a **mono-repo** with clear subfolders for AWS and Okta, then used **conditional jobs** so each path triggers only when its branch changes (e.g., `main` → AWS; `okta-configs` → Okta). Secrets never land in code; they’re injected at runtime from GitHub Secrets as environment variables that match Terraform’s expectations exactly. Early failures taught me to be precise with **working-directory** paths, case-sensitive TF vars, and `.gitignore` hygiene to keep provider binaries and state out of Git. I iterated through “already exists” errors until the backend was authoritative; from there, plans stabilized, applies were idempotent, and the pipeline became a reliable control point rather than another source of drift.

**Key Design Decisions:**

- **Mono-Repository Strategy**: A single GitHub repository (`terraform-iam-lab`) was adopted to host Terraform configurations for both AWS (`terraform-aws-lab`) and Okta (`okta-terraform-lab`). This centralizes code management and simplifies cross-project visibility.
    
- **Remote Terraform State**: To ensure a single, authoritative source of truth for infrastructure state across local development and CI/CD environments, an **AWS S3 bucket** (`iam-terraform-state-bucket`) was chosen for state storage. This was paired with an **AWS DynamoDB table** (`iam-terraform-state-lock`) for state locking, preventing concurrent operations from corrupting the state file.
    
- **Conditional Workflow Execution**: GitHub Actions was selected as the CI/CD platform. The `terraform.yml` workflow was designed with explicit `if:` conditions for each step, ensuring that AWS operations only execute when changes are pushed to the `main` branch, and Okta operations only execute on the `okta-configs` branch. This provides logical separation and efficient execution within the mono-repo.
    
- **Secure Credential Management**: Sensitive API tokens and access keys are stored as **GitHub Secrets** and securely injected into the pipeline's environment using `env` variables, preventing hardcoding and exposure.

## III. Prerequisites

Before configuring the CI/CD pipeline, ensure the following components and configurations are in place:

- **GitHub Account & Repository**: An active GitHub account with a private repository named `terraform-iam-lab`.
    
- **AWS Account**: An active AWS account with an IAM user configured for programmatic access (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) with `AdministratorAccess` policy (for lab simplicity).
    
- **Okta Developer Organization**: An active Okta Developer Org with a Administrator account and a generated Okta API Token with sufficient permissions.
    
- **AWS S3 Bucket for Terraform State**: A dedicated S3 bucket named `iam-terraform-state-bucket` (in `eu-central-1`), with versioning, block public access, and default encryption enabled.
    
- **AWS DynamoDB Table for State Locking**: A DynamoDB table named `iam-terraform-state-lock` (in `eu-central-1`), with a primary key named `LockID` (String type).
    
- **Terraform CLI**: Installed and configured locally.
    
- **Git**: Installed and configured locally.
    
- **GitHub Repository Secrets**: The following secrets must be configured in your GitHub repository (`Settings > Secrets > Actions`):
    
    - `OKTA_API_TOKEN`: Your Okta API Token.
        
    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_ADMIN`: Your AWS IAM user Access Key ID.
        
    - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ADMIN`: Your AWS IAM user Secret Access Key.
        

## IV. Configuration Steps: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

This section outlines the steps to establish the CI/CD pipeline.

### A. Local Repository Setup & Synchronization

1. **Create GitHub repository and ensure a Clean Local Repository**:
    - Create proper local repository file structure
terraform-iam-lab/
├─ terraform-aws-lab/
│  ├─ versions.tf
│  └─ main.tf
├─ okta-terraform-lab/
│  ├─ versions.tf
│  └─ main.tf
└─ .github/workflows/terraform.yml

  - Create Repository in gitHub

  - Initialize git changes to the correct branch, add and Comit
<img width="686" height="232" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-03 004730" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/865426c1-83f6-4787-9d30-585c7562d44e" />
<img width="601" height="209" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-03 004831" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f8f80a3-4d33-440a-813b-6e2c6443494b" />

  > I made some error in my file structure, causing mismatch between my local repo and GitHub repo (GitHub repo was correct)
  
- Delete any existing local `terraform-iam-lab` folder to ensure a completely clean slate.
        
    - Open your terminal and navigate to your desired parent directory (e.g., `C:/Terraform`).
        
    - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Olatife-01/terraform-iam-lab.git`
        
2. **Navigate to Repository Root**:
    
    - `cd terraform-iam-lab`
        
3. **Verify Branch and Pull Latest**:
    
    - Ensure you are on the `main` branch: `git checkout main`
        
    - Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main --rebase` (to ensure local is up-to-date with remote history).
<img width="623" height="308" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-03 004905" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afb9f4ac-e9a3-436e-a53c-ed91c1860aa5" />

 ** If there is a conflict message, Go to the file and delete everything up to ======== as this is causing conflict > re add the file **
<img width="641" height="185" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-03 004950" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3c932af-7fed-451c-9851-2ed8df9b304c" />
<img width="549" height="224" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-03 005056" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/749c3f04-0b8c-4e0b-b195-52810010ebb4" />

4. **Update `.gitignore`**:
    
    - Open the `.gitignore` file in the repository root.
        
    - Ensure it contains the standard exclusions for Terraform:
        
        ```
        # Ignore Terraform provider and state files
        .terraform/
        *.tfstate
        *.tfstate.backup
        .terraform.lock.hcl
        # Other sensitive files
        .env
        ```
        
    - Save the file.
** After fixing any conflict, ** click escape > type ":wq" to save changes ** and ** Tell rebase to continue ** and then push to gitHub **

<img width="550" height="121" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-03 005336" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d3b270f-35d0-45d0-bf92-bda36892fbde" />
<img width="660" height="245" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-03 005454" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd8fc127-6f56-42ba-9bab-cfa0862022b3" />
     

### B. Remote State Backend (S3 + DynamoDB) — Quick Steps

1. **Create S3 state bucket**
   Create a private, versioned bucket in `eu-central-1` (e.g., `iam-terraform-state-bucket`). Enable **Block public access** and **Default encryption**.
   <img width="1841" height="674" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-05 110419" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44717115-4f26-4664-9ddd-7fa1c0b686a4" />


2. **Create DynamoDB lock table**
   Create table `iam-terraform-state-lock` with **Partition key** `LockID (String)`; keep default (on-demand) capacity.
   <img width="1899" height="1095" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-05 110954" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1e50346-7678-44c5-a32a-4b7d33ae9a5f" />

3. **Point Terraform to the backend**
   Add this to each project’s `versions.tf`, then run `terraform init -reconfigure` in each folder to migrate local state:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "iam-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "<project>/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "eu-central-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "iam-terraform-state-lock"
  }
}
```

(You’ll see Terraform acquire the state **lock** during plan/apply.)
<img width="1981" height="754" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-05 112811" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3258d45-0f25-41c4-9924-516b94560223" />

4. **Verify state + locks**
   Confirm the two state objects exist in S3 and corresponding **LockID** items appear in DynamoDB when plans run.
<img width="1817" height="1254" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-05 115008" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e513076b-7572-4ff2-96cb-4c8e56fd9b02" />

5. **Commit & trigger pipeline**
   Commit the backend changes and push; watch GitHub Actions run `init/plan/apply` using the shared backend.
  <img width="728" height="760" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-05 124821" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0dc69cf-b454-49cf-8d59-d769652197b0" />

### C. Terraform Configuration Updates (Local) to avoid Terraform trying to destroy and recreate the already existing resources

1. **For `terraform-aws-lab`**:
    
    - Navigate to `terraform-aws-lab/`.
        
    - Open `versions.tf`. Add the S3 backend configuration within the `terraform` block:
        
        ```
        # versions.tf
        terraform {
          required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
        
          required_providers {
            aws = {
              source  = "hashicorp/aws"
              version = "~> 5.0"
            }
          }
          backend "s3" {
            bucket         = "iam-terraform-state-bucket"
            key            = "aws-project/terraform.tfstate"
            region         = "eu-central-1"
            encrypt        = true
            dynamodb_table = "iam-terraform-state-lock"
          }
        }
        ```
        
    - Open `main.tf`. Ensure `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` is added to all `resource` blocks (e.g., `aws_iam_group`, `aws_iam_user`, `aws_s3_bucket`, `aws_security_group`, `aws_instance`).
        
    - Run `terraform init` (to initialize the backend and migrate local state to S3).
        
2. **For `okta-terraform-lab`**:
    
    - Navigate to `okta-terraform-lab/`.
        
    - Open `versions.tf`. Add the S3 backend configuration within the `terraform` block:
        
        ```
        # versions.tf
        terraform {
          required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
        
          required_providers {
            okta = {
              source  = "okta/okta"
              version = "~> 4.0" # Use a compatible version for the Okta provider
            }
          }
          backend "s3" {
            bucket         = "iam-terraform-state-bucket"
            key            = "okta-project/terraform.tfstate"
            region         = "eu-central-1"
            encrypt        = true
            dynamodb_table = "iam-terraform-state-lock"
          }
        }
        ```
        
    - Open `main.tf`. Ensure `lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true }` is added to `okta_group` and `okta_user` resources.
        
    - Run `terraform init` (to initialize the backend and migrate local state to S3).
        

### D. GitHub Actions Workflow File (`.github/workflows/terraform.yml`)

1. **Create the Workflow Directory**:
    
    - Navigate to the repository root (`terraform-iam-lab/`).
        
    - `mkdir -p .github/workflows`
        
2. **Create `terraform.yml`**:
    
    - Create a new file named `terraform.yml` inside the `.github/workflows/` directory.
        
    - Paste the following content into the file:
        
        ```
        name: "Terraform CI/CD"
        
        on:
          push:
            branches:
              - main
              - okta-configs
          pull_request:
            branches:
              - main
              - okta-configs
        
        jobs:
          terraform:
            name: "Run Terraform Plan and Apply"
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            env:
              TF_VAR_OKTA_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.OKTA_API_TOKEN }}
              AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_ADMIN }}
              AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ADMIN }}
              AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: eu-central-1
        
            steps:
              - name: Checkout code
                uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
              - name: Set up Terraform CLI
                uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1
                with:
                  terraform_version: 1.x.x
        
              # --- AWS Steps: Only on main ---
              - name: Initialize AWS Terraform
                if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
                run: terraform init
                working-directory: terraform-aws-lab
        
              - name: Terraform Plan (AWS)
                if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
                run: terraform plan
                working-directory: terraform-aws-lab
        
              - name: Terraform Apply (AWS)
                if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
                run: terraform apply -auto-approve
                working-directory: terraform-aws-lab
        
              # --- Okta Steps: Only on okta-configs ---
              - name: Initialize Okta Terraform
                if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/okta-configs'
                run: terraform init
                working-directory: okta-terraform-lab
        
              - name: Terraform Plan (Okta)
                if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/okta-configs'
                run: terraform plan
                working-directory: okta-terraform-lab
        
              - name: Terraform Apply (Okta)
                if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/okta-configs' && github.event_name == 'push'
                run: terraform apply -auto-approve
                working-directory: okta-terraform-lab
        ```
        
    - Save the file.
        

### E. Final Git Commit and Push

1. **Navigate to Repository Root**: `cd C:/Terraform/terraform-iam-lab`
    
2. **Stage all changes**: `git add .`
    
3. **Commit changes**: `git commit -m "feat: Final CI/CD setup with remote backend and conditional workflows"`
    
4. **Push to `main` branch**: `git push origin main`
    
5. **Push `okta-configs` branch**: `git push origin okta-configs` (if not already pushed with latest changes)
<img width="874" height="430" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-03 014923" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d5d884e-dc92-450b-b2ff-7d850e9390f8" />

## V. General Analysis

The successful implementation of this CI/CD pipeline marks a significant milestone for the Enterprise IAM Lab Project. It validates the project's ability to manage infrastructure as code in an automated, secure, and idempotent manner. The mono-repo strategy, combined with conditional execution, provides a scalable and maintainable framework for future IAM deployments.

## VI. Lessons Learned

The journey to a fully functional CI/CD pipeline provided invaluable insights into best practices and common pitfalls in IaC automation:

- **Idempotency & Remote State are Foundational**: The recurring "already exists" errors underscored the absolute necessity of a shared, persistent remote state (S3 + DynamoDB) for idempotent deployments in CI/CD environments.
    
- **Precision in Pathing**: GitHub Actions `working-directory` paths must be meticulously defined and relative to the repository root. Subtle errors in pathing were a consistent source of pipeline failures.
    
- **Git Discipline is Paramount**: Complex scenarios involving multiple branches, manual file movements, and diverging histories necessitate strict adherence to Git commands (`git pull --rebase`, `git reset --hard`, `git rm --cached`, `git push -u origin <local>:<remote>`) to maintain a clean and synchronized repository.
    
- **Case-Sensitivity Across Platforms**: Mismatches in variable naming conventions (e.g., `TF_VAR_okta_api_token` vs. `OKTA_API_TOKEN`) between Terraform, environment variables, and GitHub Secrets can lead to silent failures and require careful attention.
    
- **`.gitignore` is a Security Control**: Properly configuring `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive state files, provider binaries (often large), and other transient files is crucial for both security and repository hygiene.
    
- **Conditional Logic for Mono-Repos**: Using `if:` conditions in the workflow is essential for running specific steps based on the branch or context, ensuring efficiency and preventing errors in multi-project repositories.
    
- **Troubleshooting Requires Patience & Systemic Approach**: Resolving complex CI/CD issues often requires a systematic approach, isolating variables, and verifying each step, demonstrating resilience and problem-solving skills.
    

# Advanced CI/CD: Implementing a Git Workflow for Okta IaC

## I. Objective & Purpose

The pipeline is the guardrail; Git is the change ledger. I protect `main`, require PRs, and let Actions run `fmt/validate/plan` on every PR so reviewers see **exactly** what Terraform intends to do. Only after approval do I merge, which triggers a dedicated `apply`. That sequence gives me attribution, repeatability, and an approval trail suitable for audits.

## II. Technical Thought Process & Design Decisions

The design of this workflow is a direct response to the need for a more secure and reliable process. While our existing pipeline is effective for a single developer, it lacks the necessary controls for a team environment. The core principles behind this new workflow are:

- **Main Branch Protection**: The `main` branch, which represents the live state of our Okta tenant, must be protected. No changes should be pushed directly to it.
    
- **Peer Review**: All code changes must be reviewed by at least one other team member. This reduces errors, shares knowledge, and ensures a consistent approach to the code.
    
- **Automated Validation**: The CI/CD pipeline must act as the first line of defense. It should automatically check every proposed change for syntax errors, formatting issues, and the potential impact on our Okta tenant.
    
- **Auditability**: Every step of the process—from the initial commit to the final merge—is recorded in our Git history and in the pull request itself, providing a complete and transparent audit trail.
    

This workflow transforms our `main` branch into a stable, deployable artifact, ensuring that our live Okta tenant is always a direct reflection of a validated and approved codebase.

## III. Conceptual Workflow: Step-by-Step

This is a conceptual walkthrough of how we would use this workflow to add a new Okta group.

### Step 1: Create a Feature Branch 

Instead of modifying the `main` branch directly, a developer would create a new branch from `main` to work on their specific feature. This isolates the changes and keeps the `main` branch stable.

```
# The developer checks out a new branch for their work.
git checkout -b feature/add-new-admin-group
```

### Step 2: Write the Terraform Code 

The developer would then open the `main.tf` file and add the Terraform code for the new Okta group.

```
# main.tf (Conceptual Change)
resource "okta_group" "admin_support" {
  name        = "Admin_Support"
  description = "Group for administrative support personnel."
}
```

### Step 3: Commit and Push the Changes 

After saving the file, commit the changes with a clear, descriptive message and push the new branch to GitHub.

```
# Add the changed file to staging
git add main.tf

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Add new 'Admin_Support' group"

# Push the new branch to the remote repository
git push origin feature/add-new-admin-group
```

### Step 4: Create a Pull Request (PR)

On GitHub, open a pull request to merge their `feature/add-new-admin-group` branch into the `main` branch. This PR is the central point for discussion, review, and automation.

### Step 5: Automated Validation (CI/CD Pipeline)

When the PR is created, it would automatically trigger the CI/CD pipeline. This pipeline would perform the following non-destructive, validation-only tasks:

- **Terraform Format**: `terraform fmt --check` ensures the code is correctly formatted.
    
- **Terraform Validation**: `terraform validate` checks the code for syntax errors.
    
- **Terraform Plan**: `terraform plan` generates a plan of the changes. The output of this plan would be posted as a comment on the PR, showing exactly what resources will be created, updated, or destroyed. This provides complete transparency and allows the reviewer to see the impact of the changes.
    

### Step 6: Peer Review & Approval

A teammate would review the code in the PR, check the output of the automated `terraform plan`, and provide feedback or approval. Once approved, the PR can be merged.

### Step 7: Merge and Deploy

Once the PR is approved and merged into `main`, a separate, dedicated CI/CD pipeline job would trigger. This job's sole purpose is to run the final `terraform apply` command, deploying the approved changes to the live Okta tenant. The `main` branch now reflects the new state of the infrastructure.

## IV. Testing & Outcome

The "testing" in this workflow is a continuous, automated process. The **`terraform plan`** command, triggered by the PR, is the primary test. Its output is the proof that the proposed changes are what I intend to apply.

The final outcome is a secure and robust IaC process. The `main` branch is no longer a sandbox but a protected representation of the production Okta tenant. Every change is verified by both an automated system and a human reviewer, drastically reducing the risk of errors and unauthorized modifications. The audit trail is complete, and disaster recovery plan is strengthened.

> I keep **AWS** changes on `main` and **Okta** changes on `okta-configs`. You can tighten this further with branch protection + required checks.

### D) Commit & push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: CI/CD with S3+DynamoDB backend and branch-scoped jobs"
git push origin main
git push origin okta-configs
```


## V. **Challenges Encountered & Resolutions (Evolution of Configuration):**

1. **Initial "Resource Already Exists" Errors**:
    
    - **Problem**: Early pipeline runs failed with `EntityAlreadyExists`, `BucketAlreadyOwnedByYou`, and `InvalidGroup.Duplicate` errors. This indicated that Terraform, running in an ephemeral CI/CD environment, was attempting to re-create resources that already existed in the target cloud.
        
    - **Resolution**: This was resolved by implementing the **remote Terraform state backend (S3 + DynamoDB)**. This ensured the CI/CD runner always started with an up-to-date understanding of the deployed infrastructure, enabling idempotent `terraform apply` operations.
        
2. **Incorrect Working Directory Paths**:
    
    - **Problem**: The pipeline consistently failed with "No such file or directory" errors, indicating that the `working-directory` paths in `terraform.yml` were not correctly resolving relative to the GitHub Actions runner's environment.
        
    - **Resolution**: Paths were meticulously corrected to be simple, single-level names (e.g., `terraform-aws-lab`, `okta-terraform-lab`), directly referencing the subdirectories within the repository root. This eliminated redundant path segments and allowed the runner to locate the configuration files.
        
3. **Git Repository Structure & Synchronization Issues**:
    
    - **Problem**: Multiple manual file moves, nested `.git` folders, and conflicting local/remote histories led to persistent `non-fast-forward` push rejections, `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories`, and complex merge conflicts (`add/add`, `rename/rename`).
        
    - **Resolution**: A systematic approach was adopted, involving:
        
        - **Complete Local Resets**: Using `git reset --hard` and `rm -rf .git` to clear local Git history and ensure a clean slate when issues became too complex.
            
        - **Precise Clones**: Re-cloning the repository to establish a correct, non-nested local structure.
            
        - **Explicit Branching**: Ensuring all work was performed on and pushed to the correct feature branches (`main` for AWS, `okta-configs` for Okta).
            
        - **Careful Staging/Committing**: Using `git add .` from the repository root to correctly stage all files and `git commit` to record changes.
            
4. **Terraform Variable Case-Sensitivity**:
    
    - **Problem**: The Okta Terraform provider failed to receive its API token, prompting for `var.OKTA_API_TOKEN` despite the secret being present.
        
    - **Resolution**: This was due to a case-sensitivity mismatch. The environment variable in `terraform.yml` (`TF_VAR_okta_api_token`) was corrected to precisely match the uppercase Terraform variable (`TF_VAR_OKTA_API_TOKEN`), ensuring the token was correctly injected.
        
5. **State Locking Failures**:
    
    - **Problem**: Pipeline runs occasionally failed with "Error acquiring the state lock" due to a `ConditionalCheckFailedException` in DynamoDB.
        
    - **Resolution**: This indicated a previous Terraform process had not properly released the lock. Manual intervention was required to delete the stale lock item from the `iam-terraform-state-lock` DynamoDB table.
        
6. **Large Files in Git**:
    
    - **Problem**: Attempts to push large Terraform provider executables (`.exe` files exceeding 100MB) resulted in GitHub's file size limit errors.
        
    - **Resolution**: The `.gitignore` file was meticulously configured to explicitly exclude the `.terraform/` directory (which contains provider binaries) and all `.tfstate` files, preventing them from being committed to the repository.
       
## VI. Next Steps & Enhancements

With the CI/CD pipeline successfully established, future enhancements for the Enterprise IAM Lab can focus on maturing the IaC and security aspects:

- **Expand Terraform Scope**: Extend Terraform configurations to manage a broader range of Okta resources (e.g., applications, authentication policies, network zones) and more granular AWS IAM roles and policies.
    
- **Integrate Policy-as-Code**: Implement tools like HashiCorp Sentinel or Open Policy Agent (OPA) to enforce organizational policies on Terraform plans, ensuring compliance with security, cost, and operational standards before deployment.
    
- **Advanced Secrets Management**: Explore deeper integration with HashiCorp Vault to dynamically generate and manage all types of secrets (e.g., database credentials, application API keys) directly within Terraform, further reducing static credential exposure.
    
- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated integration and end-to-end tests for deployed infrastructure, especially for IAM policies, to verify that users/roles possess only the intended access.
    
- **Drift Detection**: Configure tools or processes to regularly detect configuration drift, identifying changes made to infrastructure outside of Terraform's management.
    
- **Git LFS Implementation**: For any large binary files (e.g., Terraform provider executables if they exceed GitHub's limits), implement Git Large File Storage to manage them efficiently.
