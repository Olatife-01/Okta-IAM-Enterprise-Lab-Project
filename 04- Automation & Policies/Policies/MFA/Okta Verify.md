# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with Okta Verify

## Purpose
Implement a strong second factor of authentication (MFA) using Okta Verify. This significantly enhances the security posture of user accounts by requiring something the user *has* (their phone with Okta Verify) in addition to something they *know* (their password). This implementation is specifically targeted at a small group of test users to allow for controlled testing in the lab.

## Technical Thought Process & Evolution of Configuration

MFA is a foundational control for modern access management: credentials get phished; device-bound factors dramatically limit blast radius. Okta Verify was selected because it balances **security** (device binding, push challenge, TOTP) with **low friction** (tap-to-approve) and integrates natively with Okta’s policy engine. Rather than turning on MFA tenant-wide, the lab applies a **least-surprise, phased** approach: create a dedicated **Lab Users** group, enforce MFA only for that group, then iterate. Okta’s **Authenticators** control which factors are available, while **policy** determines **when** they’re required (per user/group and per sign-in context). For early tests, we permitted both Push and TOTP to validate enrollment paths, and we kept “user gesture” off to streamline UX during the lab. The policy is scoped to sign-in events (re-auth “every time” for clear, observable results), and ordered above defaults to guarantee precedence. Validation deliberately includes **negative cases** (users not in Lab Users) to prove scoping works. This approach mirrors enterprise change control: pilot first, measure user impact and security outcomes, then expand with stronger options (e.g., device posture, phishing-resistant WebAuthn) as the lab matures.
* **Layered Security:** MFA is a critical security control, acting as a second line of defense against credential theft and phishing. Even if a password is compromised, access is protected.
* **Okta Verify as Preferred Factor:** Okta Verify offers convenient push notifications and TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) codes, providing a good balance of security and user experience. Push is generally preferred for ease of use.
* **Authentication Policies:** Okta's policy engine allows for granular control over *when* and *which* users are prompted for MFA. This enables enforcing MFA for specific groups (e.g., all employees) while potentially having different policies for administrators or guests.
* **Targeted Testing:** By creating a dedicated `Lab Users` group and assigning the MFA policy only to it, we simulate a controlled, phased rollout or a specific requirement for a subset of users. This is a common and best practice approach in real-world deployments to minimize disruption.

## Configuration Steps Performed

### A. Enable Okta Verify Authenticator:
1.  Logged into the Okta Admin Console.
2.  Navigated to **"Security" > "Authenticators"**.
3.  Located **"Okta Verify"** and ensured its status was **"Active."** (If not, activated it via the "Actions" menu).
4.  Clicked "Actions" > "Edit" for Okta Verify.
5.  Confirmed "Allow users to choose between push notification or TOTP when enrolling" was checked.
6.  Left "Require user gesture for Okta Verify push notifications" unchecked for simplified lab testing.
7.  Clicked **"Save"**.

### B. Create "Lab Users" Group and Assign Users:
1.  From the Okta Admin Console, navigated to **"Directory" > "Groups"**.
2.  Clicked the green **"Add Group"** button.
3.  **Group Name:** `Lab Users`
    * Description: `A dedicated group for testing and lab purposes, particularly for MFA policy application.`
4.  Clicked **"Add Group"**.
5.  After the group was created, clicked on the `Lab Users` group name to view its details.
6.  Navigated to the **"Members"** tab.
7.  Clicked the **"Add People"** button.
8.  Searched for and selected 5 specific users from the previously imported list (e.g., `test.user`, plus 4 other users) to add them to this group.
9.  Clicked **"Save"** to add the users.

### C. Create and Configure Okta Sign-on Policy for MFA:
1.  Navigated to **"Security" > "Authentication Policies"**.
2.  Clicked the green **"Add a new Okta Sign-on Policy"** button.
3.  **Policy Name:** `Lab User MFA Policy`
4.  **Description:** `Requires MFA for test users in the dedicated lab users group.`
5.  **Assignments:**
    * **"Assign to groups"**: Click this.
    * Searched `Lab Users` and selected it.
    * Clicked **"Add."**
    * *(Ensured that Employee Group, Service Principal Group, and Guest Group were NOT assigned to this policy.)*
6.  Clicked **"Create Policy and Add Rule."**
7.  On the "Add Rule" page:
    * **Rule Name:** `Require MFA for Lab Users Group`
    * **AND multifactor authentication is:** Set to **"Required"**.
    * **User must authenticate with:** Checked **"Okta Verify"** for "Authentication methods."
    * **Re-authentication frequency:** Set to **"Every time a user signs in."**
8.  Clicked **"Create Rule"**.
9.  Ensured the `Lab User MFA Policy` was **Active** and positioned correctly (e.g., above the Default Policy to ensure it takes precedence for `Lab Users`) in the policy list.

## Testing and Validation

1.  **Mobile App Installation:** Downloaded and installed the "Okta Verify" app on my mobile device (iOS/Android).
2.  **MFA Enrollment Trigger (for a user in 'Lab Users' group):**
    * Opened a new Incognito/Private browser window.
    * Navigated to the Okta End-User Dashboard (`your-okta-org-url.okta.com/enduser/dashboard`).
    * Attempted to log in as `test.user` (who is a member of the `Lab Users` group) with their password.
    * Observed that Okta prompted for MFA enrollment.

3.  **Okta Verify Setup:**
    * Selected "Okta Verify" on the browser screen and clicked "Setup."

    * Scanned the displayed QR code using the Okta Verify app on my phone.

    * Completed the enrollment prompts within the Okta Verify app (e.g., enabling push notifications).
4.  **Initial Login Completion:** Confirmed the browser session completed the login successfully after MFA enrollment.

5.  **Subsequent MFA Test:**
    * Logged out of the `test.user` session.
    * Opened a fresh Incognito/Private window.
    * Attempted to log in again as `test.user`.
    * Observed that after entering the password, Okta immediately prompted for an Okta Verify push notification (or TOTP code).
    * Approved the push notification on the mobile device.
    * Successfully logged into the Okta End-User Dashboard.

6.  **Verification for Users NOT in 'Lab Users' Group:**
    * Attempted to log in as a user who is *not* a member of the `Lab Users` group (e.g., a general `Employee Group` member not manually added to `Lab Users`).
    * Observed that this user was **NOT** prompted for MFA, confirming the policy's targeted application.
## Challenges & Solutions (Optional - for your real experience)
* User will not be able to login to Org, until Activation flow and MFA enrolment has been successfully done.
* No issues as user Login was successful.
